This simple HTML file shows off a basic 3D scene built using A-Frame (v1.7.0), a cool tool to quickly create 3D and VR stuff directly in HTML.

When you run this file, you'll see:
- A pinkish torus floating.
- A dark-blue tetrahedron on the right.
- A big, green cone placed.
- A clean, light-grey sky as the background.
